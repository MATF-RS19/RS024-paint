# RS024-paint

This application represents our version of Paint program with option of using layers from Photoshop.

## About application:

This is our project for the subject Software development under management of assistant Dr. Ivan Cukic and professor Dr. Sasa Malkov on the University of Belgrade, Facultity of Mathematics.

## How to run?

Since we built this application in Qt(Creator), you will need it to run the app.
1. Open project
2. Build it
3. Run!

## How to use?

We constructed interface of this app to be as friendly and known as possible.

In the first toolbar you can make new sheet, open picture, save current picture under current name, save as new picture or overwrite the some other picture, and some operations on the whole scene as rotate and zooming.

In the second toolbar are all basic operations you can do when drawing: using pencil, fill area, erase something, undo/redo commands and shapes menu.
On the right side of that bar you can see commands for adding, deletion or joining (one or more) of the layers which are right beneath those commands.

And the rest depends on your creativity. :)
